# SampleTrainer
Simple app I made to memorize drum samples in a groove context.

TODO:\

Make the repository more independent from the Model. maybe just by lowering the rowIds into the Model.
An intermediate state to properly audition the samples.\
A proper game loop, maybe reactive, maybe using "typesafe" valueTrees.\
A sample waveform visualizer in the selector.\
"Add Folder", "Add Files", "Remove Sample" buttons.\
Behaviour if there's a single sample in a quizz column.\
UI.\
Background loading.\
