# SampleTrainer
Simple app I made to memorize drum samples in a groove context.

TODO:

high priority/easy : \
rework the symbols/namespace and imports\
"Add Folder", "Add Files", "Remove Sample" buttons.\
Behaviour if there's a single sample in a quizz column.\

intermediate : \
integrate to sample repository into the application model\


osef/hard : \
A sample waveform visualizer in the selector.\
A sequencer interface, midi import.\
UI & graphics work.\
