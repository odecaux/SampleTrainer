# SampleTrainer
Simple app I made to memorize drum samples in a groove context.

TODO:

rework the symbols/namespace and imports\
Make the repository more independent from the Model. maybe just by lowering the rowIds into the Model.\
An intermediate state to properly audition the samples.\
A sample waveform visualizer in the selector.\
"Add Folder", "Add Files", "Remove Sample" buttons.\
Behaviour if there's a single sample in a quizz column.\
A sequencer interface, midi import.\
UI & graphics work.\
Background loading.
