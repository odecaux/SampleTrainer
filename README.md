An intermediate state to properly audition the samples.\
rework the symbols/namespace and imports\
"Add Folder", "Add Files", "Remove Sample" buttons.\

intermediate : \
integrate to sample repository into the application model\
A sample waveform visualizer in the selector.\


osef/hard : \
Behaviour if there's a single sample in a quizz column.\
A sequencer interface, midi import.\
UI & graphics work.\
Background loading.
